## About
Crav’n is a platform that provides restaurant recommendations and recipe information based on a specific dish, or rather, what you crave.
Find your ideal restaurant/recipe.
Relax and enjoy your meal!

Our focus is to provide a streamline interface that features your desired dish, top reviews, and contact information.
Feeling inspired to cook? Find recipes to make at home based on what you have in your pantry.

## Objective 
Our target audience are towards people who want a narrow search from their specific inputs. Our platform will cater to their specific requests based on their food searches and whether they want to dine out or cook at home. 

The problem users face when searching for places to eat or figuring out what sort of food they want is when they encounter too many options to choose from. By having the user input a type of dish or ingredient on the website, the user would not be overwhelmed by search results that doesn’t meet that criteria. 

The primary goal is to save time by giving the user an efficient platform to help narrow their restaurant and food searches.
