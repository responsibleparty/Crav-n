## Crav'n 
Crav’n is a platform that provides users restaurant and recipe information based on what they are “craving.” 

Crav'n will help make a foodie's life simpler by doing the work for them. 

Crav’n will search what the foodie is craving by having them input a food item in the search bar and then it will return the best restaurants and/or recipes that suits their specific criteria. Whether they are vegan, gluten-free, vegetarian, or etc, they will be able to find their ideal place or recipe to enjoy their meal.

## Motivation
This project came to realization after brainstorming on how we can create a website that is compact, simple, and easy to use by showing both restaurants and recipes side by side. Pulling restaurant searches and recipes gives the user options to either eat locally or be creative to cook right at home. 

## Features
What sets Crav'n apart from other applications? Streamline interface that includes restaurant information such as menu items, top reviews, and contact information if the user decides where to eat. If the user is inspired by a dish from their favorite restaurant, they can also do a search and look up recipes to cook at home.
